        <p> Hello, my name is Gidget Roberts. I am working on multiple degrees full time at both East Carolina Uniersity and Wake Tech Community College. While I haven't gotten any work experience just yet, I hope my efforts here and beyond will help me find the job I am looking for most. I hope to eventually find a job in the marketing and advertising market. To do this, I am working on a college of business degree at ECU, as well as getting a web and graphic design certification at Wake Tech. When I'm not working on these programs, I am usually writing story concepts or drawing character designs as a hobby. </p>
        <P> I have worked on multiple projects regarding web design, such as a final projecct to make a business website featuring multiple pages and navigation, user interfact quality, and accessibility features like alt text and resizing for different screen sizes.</P>
